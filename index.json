Its connected experiences, which include competitive cycling classes, are a key offering that motivates its members to track and meet their fitness goals in a mobile app.\nHowever, delivering fitness insights in near real time was a challenge for the company. When it first developed its connected experiences, Equinox ran its workloads on a Windows-based server. Each service ran as an individual task. This meant that Equinox’s engineers had to broker updates for each service, which was time-consuming and led to inconsistencies in software updates.\n“It was a nightmare,” says Sindhura Nallapareddy, senior director of engineering at Equinox. “It wasn’t just one component that we had to manage. We had to check on our servers, databases, and the message broker installations every time we made an update.”\nEquinox wanted to streamline software updates for its engineers and support near real-time data streaming. So, the company turned to Amazon Web Services (AWS) to rearchitect its stack.\n“We did not want to be held back with operational challenges,” says Nallapareddy. “We wanted to focus on the possibilities that we could create, including fitness challenges in our studios and across our clubs.”\nConnecting Its In-Club Devices to the Cloud Using AWS IoT Core Equinox evaluated cloud-based solutions to support near real-time data processing and streamline engineering workflows. Prioritizing for stability and ease of use, Equinox tested AWS IoT Core, which easily and securely connect devices to the cloud.\nTo gather data from its bikes, Equinox uses VAST Internet of Things (IoT) devices that are installed on its workout equipment. These devices followed MPU protocol. Before adopting AWS IoT Core, the company gathered data from its bikes in user datagram protocol (UDP) packets, which were stored on PCs connected to local networks.\nAfter collection, data was processed using custom actions and jobs. These jobs would run for several hours before delivering fitness insights to the mobile app for members.\n“The proof of concept that we created was to see if we could sync data from our edge servers to AWS and if we could reliably establish cloud connectivity to support more seamless deployments,” says Aneesh Pillai, engineer at Equinox.\nUsing AWS IoT core, the company can collect UDP packets from its bikes using MQTT protocol, which then transmits data into its edge servers and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), an object storage service built to retrieve any amount of data from anywhere.\nBy storing its data on edge devices and in the cloud, Equinox has reduced the likelihood of data loss, improving overall data quality.\n“We appreciate the reliability of the data that is sent between our edge servers and AWS,” says Pillai. “The speed and ease of managing these components are top-tier benefits for me.”\nMaking Unified Software Deployments with AWS IoT Greengrass Streamlining software deployments was essential to helping engineers focus on building more personalized member experiences. So, Equinox built a software management application for its engineering team using AWS IoT Greengrass, which is an open-source edge runtime and cloud service for building, deploying, and managing device software.\nTo start, Equinox deployed a single AWS IoT Greengrass instance onto one of its edge servers. After stabilizing, the Equinox team replicated this setup across all its edge servers. Previously, Equinox collected cycling data from 48 of its clubs; using AWS IoT Greengrass, the company was able to onboard 80 clubs in a matter of months.\nWhen a software update is available, Equinox can trigger deployments while classes are occurring without experiencing data loss. Additionally, the company can initiate deployments in a single club or across all its locations.\n“That has been an important improvement for us to overcome the operational challenges we dealt with before,” says Nallapareddy. “AWS IoT Greengrass has alleviated our teams by sending updates in a bundled package.”\nSecuring Data Streaming in the Cloud Equinox implemented Amazon Data Firehose to reliably load near real-time streams into data lakes, warehouses, and analytics services. To stream its data into the cloud, Equinox’s engineers created two sets of rules for collecting data from IoT devices using Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, which can easily stream data at any scale.\nOne stream collects heartbeats and biometrics. The other stream transmits data related to bike usage, such as battery power. Data is synced into the cloud on an event basis in near real time. The company also added additional logic to its solution to calculate the number of calories burned and miles cycled, which it provides to its members through its mobile app.\n“Amazon Kinesis Data Streams is absolutely amazing,” says Pillai. “I can look right now and see all the data that’s available and which equipment is being used. It’s in near real time, and there’s no data latency or loss.”\nTo avoid duplicating data from its bikes, Equinox implemented data filtering. The engineering team also set up a second, private network for transmitting UDP packets from its bikes and other workout equipment, helping keep its members’ data secure.\nBoosting Engineering Productivity and Experimenting with AI/ML With a scalable, repeatable stack running on AWS, Equinox has freed its engineers from complex deployments and integrations. Using a custom script, Equinox can scale its IoT solution to clubs in minutes, and its engineers are saving on deployments every month.\n“We can focus on the business instead of operational challenges,” says Pillai. “We don’t have to worry about the connections between the cloud and local computers. Seamless deployments are one of the biggest benefits of our architecture.”\nThe automated setup has empowered Equinox’s engineers to focus on value-added tasks, including experimenting with artificial intelligence and machine learning. Its teams plan to use Amazon SageMaker AI to build, train, and deploy machine learning models—including foundation models—for any use case with fully managed infrastructure, tools, and workflows.\nEquinox’s engineering team is looking forward to building more personalized member offerings and predictive maintenance recommendations for its workout equipment.\n“The confidence that we have in our data has unlocked so much potential,” says Eswar Veluri, executive vice president and chief technology officer at Equinox. “We can explore club-to-club challenges, cycling milestones, and individual competitions. There is a lot of excitement across the company to uncover and unlock even more experiences.”\nGirish Nazhiyath Girish Nazhiyath currently serves as a Senior Solutions Architect at AWS.

Because of this, AWS expanded the scope of its commitment to the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) Sprint for Women’s Health performers to include its Spark funding track awardees. These awardees focus on transformative early-stage research in women’s health.\nThese Spark awardees will receive AWS credits funded by AWS Social Responsibility \u0026amp; Impact and facilitated through the ARPA-H Investor Catalyst Hub, and technical support to guide them along their journey.\n“We’re excited for this collaboration with AWS to support our early-stage researchers in accelerating their commercialization journey,” stated Chelsea Schiller, Investor Catalyst Hub director.\nLet’s take a look at some of the innovative research projects these awardees are pursuing:\nThe California Institute of Technology (CalTech) is developing a wearable sweat sensing system for objective chronic pain assessment. Their solution will simultaneously monitor multiple types of pain biomarkers in sweat. CalTech researchers will combine those biomarkers with vital sign data and create machine learning models that predict pain levels in real-time. Dr. Wei Gao, professor of medical engineering at CalTech, predicts that “real-time objective pain measurement will transform how the medical community treats patients, removing some of the guess work out of pain management.”\nNura Health is also focused on biomarkers and precision medicine. Endometriosis diagnoses can take an average of 5-10 years to diagnose due to requiring an invasive surgical procedure for confirmation. Nura Health hopes to reduce that timeline to just days—and eliminate the need for surgical confirmation—by launching a platform that measures unique biomarkers found in blood while simultaneously analyzing genetic profiles in order to recommend precise, optimal treatments. “Our solution will bring faster diagnosis and a personalized treatment plan for women, significantly revamping the path to disease detection and symptom alleviation,” Varun Kapoor, co-founder and CEO of Nura Health, stated.\nAncilia Biosciences is initially applying its unique technology to develop a novel approach to treating bacterial vaginosis, a common, recurring condition that is associated with preterm birth, sexually transmitted infections, and infertility. “Our goal is to apply our advanced analytic and biological tools to unlock the vast potential of an entirely new class of therapies with major applications in both women’s health and broader indications,” declared Dr. Alexandra Sakatos, co-founder and CEO at Ancilia Biosciences.\nGeneral Proximity, focused on transforming cancer treatment to a single drug, describes their solution as “pioneering proximity medicine in the battle against women’s cancer.” Their solution uses Induced Proximity Medicines to target a protein prevalent in breast and gynecological cancers.\nThese awardees will use AWS purpose-built health services designed to accelerate innovation. AWS provides the most comprehensive set of Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and purpose-built health services designed to handle complex health data. These awardees will leverage AWS HealthOmics to transform their genomic, transcriptomic, and other omics data into insight. They can gain insights faster, supporting their efforts to move from idea to market with virtually unlimited compute capacity with the complete suite of high performance computing (HPC) products and services on AWS.\nThe agility and scope of AWS services means health researchers have the flexibility they need to explore their research questions.

It calculates a Fit Score, detects skill gaps, and provides personalized learning suggestions.\nThe solution is implemented by a 5‑member team in 4 weeks on AWS using managed, pay‑as‑you‑go services to keep costs near zero for a demo workload. The UI is built with Next.js and hosted on AWS Amplify; the backend uses API Gateway + Lambda with DynamoDB, S3, Comprehend, Textract, and Cognito.\nKey outcomes\n90% faster CV screening for demo scenarios. Objective Fit Score with visual reports. Actionable learning roadmap per candidate. 2) Problem Statement 2.1 What’s the problem? Recruiters spend significant time manually reading CVs and comparing them to JDs. Candidates lack insight into which skills they are missing and how to improve. Existing tools are expensive or not tailored for Vietnamese/SEA use cases. 2.2 The solution Upload CV (PDF/DOCX) and JD → automatic text extraction and NLP. Detect skills, experience, education; compute Fit Score vs JD. Recommend skill pathways mapped from a small SkillOntology store. Secure login with Cognito; results shown in a clean Next.js dashboard. 3) Solution Architecture (overview) Serverless, event‑driven architecture on AWS.\nMain components\nFrontend: Next.js UI (Amplify Hosting) for upload \u0026amp; result dashboard. API Layer: Amazon API Gateway → AWS Lambda functions. Processing: parseResume → Textract (if scanned PDF) → normalized text. nlpAnalyze → Comprehend → entities/skills/phrases. recommendSkills → compares to JD + SkillOntology in DynamoDB. Data: DynamoDB (results, ontology), S3 (temporary CV/JD). Identity: Cognito (JWT access tokens). Ops: IaC with AWS SAM, CI/CD via CodeBuild + CodePipeline, logging in CloudWatch. (A Mermaid architecture diagram is provided separately.)\n4) Technical Implementation 4.1 Tech stack Backend: .NET 8 (C# Minimal API on Lambda) Frontend: Next.js + TailwindCSS (Amplify Hosting) AWS: Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, Cognito, Comprehend, Textract IaC: AWS SAM CI/CD: CodeBuild + CodePipeline 4.2 End‑to‑end flow User authenticates via Cognito and obtains JWT. Frontend requests presigned URL to S3 → uploads CV/JD. API Gateway invokes Lambda parseResume: If PDF scan → Textract → extract text; otherwise direct parse. Clean \u0026amp; normalize → store interim artifacts on S3. Lambda nlpAnalyze uses Comprehend to detect entities/skills → writes results to DynamoDB. Lambda recommendSkills loads SkillOntology from DynamoDB → compares CV vs JD → computes Fit Score + gaps. Frontend queries results via API → renders charts/tables. 4.3 Data model (DynamoDB – simplified) Table Profiles (PK: userId, SK: profileId) – store latest CV parse. Table Analyses (PK: analysisId) – fit score, gaps, timestamps. Table SkillOntology (PK: skillId, attributes: name, tags, learningPath[]). 4.4 API (high level) POST /upload-url → presign for CV/JD. POST /analyze → triggers pipeline for a given S3 key pair. GET /analyses/{id} → returns Fit Score \u0026amp; recommendations. GET /skills/{id} → (optional) fetch a skill’s learning path. 5) Timeline \u0026amp; Milestones (4 weeks) Week Milestone Deliverables 1 Foundation SAM template, DynamoDB tables, Cognito, base UI 2 Parsing \u0026amp; NLP parseResume, nlpAnalyze, JD parsing, unit tests 3 Recommender \u0026amp; FE integration recommendSkills, dashboard, charts 4 Demo \u0026amp; hardening E2E tests, logging, cost tuning, slide deck 6) Budget Estimation (demo scale) Indicative, assuming \u0026lt; 500 requests/month\nLambda: ~$0.02 API Gateway: ~$0.01 S3 (few GB, low requests): ~$0.10 DynamoDB (on‑demand, low R/W): ~$0.05 Amplify Hosting: ~$0.30 Comprehend + Textract (small pages): ~$0.40 Cognito: $0.00\nTotal ≈ $0.9 / month (~$10 / year) 7) Security, Risks \u0026amp; Mitigations Security\nPrivate S3 buckets with SSE‑KMS; presigned uploads only.

Speakers Jun Kai Loke - AI/ML Specialist SA, AWS Kien Nguyen - Solutions Architect, AWS Tamelly Lim - Storage Specialist SA, AWS Binh Tran - Senior Solutions Architect, AWS Taiki Dang - Solutions Architect, AWS Michael Armentano - Principal WW GTM Specialist, AWS Highlights 1. Building a Unified Data Foundation on AWS for AI and Analytics Workloads Unified Data Foundation: Strategies for constructing a flexible, scalable data infrastructure, focusing on Data Ingestion, Storage, Processing, and Data Governance. 2. Building the Future: Gen AI Adoption and Roadmap on AWS Vision and Trends: Sharing AWS\u0026rsquo;s comprehensive vision, emerging trends, and strategic roadmap for the adoption of Generative AI and new GenAI services. 3. AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AI-DLC) Shaping the future of Software Implementation SDLC Transformation: Redefining the software development process by embedding AI as a central collaborator (AI-powered Execution) to improve speed and quality. 4. Securing Generative AI Applications with AWS: Fundamentals and Best Practices GenAI Security Challenges: Exploring unique security risks at each layer of the GenAI stack (Infrastructure, Models, Applications). Best Practices: Guidance on how AWS integrates security measures such as encryption, Zero-Trust architecture, and fine-grained access controls. 5. Beyond Automation: AI Agents as Your Ultimate Productivity Multipliers AI Agents: Discussion on the paradigm shift from basic automation to using AI Agents (intelligent partners) capable of self-learning, adapting, and executing complex tasks. Key Takeaways Data and AI Mindset Data Foundation is Essential: All AI/Analytics efforts must start with a unified, well-governed Data Governance foundation. AI-DLC Replaces Traditional SDLC: Learned how to embed AI into the software development lifecycle to increase speed and innovation. Technical Architecture and Security Multi-layer Security in GenAI: Security must extend beyond infrastructure to protect both the model and the application flow using measures like encryption and Zero-Trust. AI Agents - New Level of Automation: Understood the potential of AI Agents in automating complex processes and exponentially multiplying business productivity. Application to Work Enhancing Data Governance: Applying learned data governance methods to establish unified data storage, processing, and security principles for AI/ML projects. AI-DLC Experimentation: Researching and piloting the integration of AI tools (such as Amazon Q) into the development process to automate repetitive tasks. GenAI Security Design: Ensuring that multi-layer security principles (data encryption, access control) are applied from the start when designing GenAI applications. Event Experience Participating in the Track for Builders was a highly valuable experience, focused entirely on data-driven and AI-centric architecture.\nFoundational and Strategic Knowledge: I gained access not only to specific AWS services but also to the overall strategy for building a data foundation for AI and the GenAI roadmap. Vision for Software Development: The discussion on AI-DLC changed my perspective on SDLC, placing AI at the center of software creation.

Connect to EC2 with session manager For this workshop, you will use AWS Session Manager to access several EC2 instances. Session Manager is a fully managed AWS Systems Manager capability that allows you to manage your Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises virtual machines (VMs) through an interactive one-click browser-based shell. Session Manager provides secure and auditable instance management without the need to open inbound ports, maintain bastion hosts, or manage SSH keys.\nFirst cloud journey Lab for indepth understanding of Session manager.\nIn the AWS Management Console, start typing Systems Manager in the quick search box and press Enter: From the Systems Manager menu, find Node Management in the left menu and click Session Manager: Click Start Session, and select the EC2 instance named Test-Gateway-Endpoint. This EC2 instance is already running in \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; and will be used to test connectivity to Amazon S3 through the Gateway endpoint you just created (s3-gwe).\nSession Manager will open a new browser tab with a shell prompt: sh-4.2 $\nYou have successfully start a session - connect to the EC2 instance in VPC cloud.

Upload file to S3 bucket with command aws s3 cp testfile.xyz s3://your-bucket-name. Replace your-bucket-name with the name of S3 bucket that you created earlier. You have successfully uploaded the file to your S3 bucket. You can now terminate the session.\nCheck object in S3 bucket Navigate to S3 console. Click the name of your s3 bucket In the Bucket console, you will see the file you have uploaded to your S3 bucket Section summary Congratulation on completing access to S3 from VPC. In this section, you created a Gateway endpoint for Amazon S3, and used the AWS CLI to upload an object. The upload worked because the Gateway endpoint allowed communication to S3, without needing an Internet Gateway attached to \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo;. This demonstrates the functionality of the Gateway endpoint as a secure path to S3 without traversing the Public Internet.\n"},{"uri":"https://nhutruong47.github.io/aws/1-worklog/1.2-week2/","title":"Week 2 Worklog","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Objectives for Week 2: Clearly understand the role and operation of the EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) virtual server service.

Understood the components that make up an EC2 instance. IAM Roles: Understood the advantages and usage of IAM Role (Instance Profile) to securely grant AWS service access permissions to EC2 resources, eliminating the need to store Access Keys on the server. Advanced AWS CLI: Learned how to use CLI commands to manage EC2 Instance states (Start, Stop, Describe) and perform remote operations. Integration Practice: Proved that the EC2 Instance can execute actions on S3 (e.g., aws s3 ls) thanks to permissions granted via IAM Role, confirming the security model works effectively. Resource Cleanup: Grasped the process of terminating EC2 Instances and cleaning up related IAM resources to ensure no costs are incurred.

With this capability, you can use your customized local VS Code setup, including AI-assisted development tools, custom extensions, and debugging tools while accessing compute resources and your data in SageMaker Studio. By accessing familiar model development features, data scientists can maintain their established workflows, preserve their productivity tools, and seamlessly develop, train, and deploy machine learning, deep learning and generative AI models.\nIn this post, we show you how to remotely connect your local VS Code to SageMaker Studio development environments to use your customized development environment while accessing Amazon SageMaker AI compute resources.\nThe local integrated development environment (IDE) connection capability delivers three key benefits for developers and data scientists:\nFamiliar development environment with scalable compute: Work in your familiar IDE environment while harnessing the purpose-built model development environment of SageMaker AI. Keep your preferred themes, shortcuts, extensions, productivity, and AI tools while accessing SageMaker AI features. Simplify operations: With a few clicks, you can minimize the complex configurations and administrative overhead of setting up remote access to SageMaker Studio spaces. The integration provides direct access to Studio spaces from your IDE. Enterprise grade security: Benefit from secure connections between your IDE and SageMaker AI through automatic credentials management and session maintenance. In addition, code execution remains within the controlled boundaries of SageMaker AI. This feature bridges the gap between local development preferences and cloud-based machine learning resources, so that teams can improve their productivity while using the features of Amazon SageMaker AI.\nSolution overview The following diagram showcases the interaction between your local IDE and SageMaker Studio spaces.\nThe solution architecture consists of three main components:\nLocal computer: Your development machine running VS Code with AWS Toolkit extension installed. SageMaker Studio: A unified, web-based ML development environment to seamlessly build, train, deploy, and manage machine learning and analytics workflows at scale using integrated AWS tools and secure, governed access to your data. AWS Systems Manager: A secure, scalable remote access and management service that enables seamless connectivity between your local VS Code and SageMaker Studio spaces to streamline ML development workflows. The connection flow supports two options:\nDirect launch (deep link): Users can initiate the connection directly from the SageMaker Studio web interface by choosing Open in VS Code, which automatically launches their local VS Code instance. AWS Toolkit connection: Users can connect through AWS Toolkit extension in VS Code by browsing available SageMaker Studio spaces and selecting their target environment. In addition to the preceding, users can also connect to their space directly from their IDE terminal using SSH. For instructions on connecting using SSH, refer to documentation here.\nAfter connecting, developers can:\nUse their custom VS Code extensions and tools Remotely access and use their space’s storage Run their AI and ML workloads in SageMaker compute environments Work with notebooks in their preferred IDE Maintain the same security parameters as the SageMaker Studio web environment Solution implementation Prerequisites To try the remote IDE connection, you must meet the following prerequisites:\nYou have access to a SageMaker Studio domain with connectivity to the internet. For domains set up in VPC-only mode, your domain should have a route out to the internet through a proxy, or a NAT gateway. If your domain is completely isolated from the internet, see Connect to VPC with subnets without internet access for setting up the remote connection. If you do not have a Studio domain, you can create one using the quick setup or custom setup option. You have permissions to update the SageMaker Studio domain or user execution role in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). You have the latest stable VS Code with Microsoft Remote SSH (version 0.74.0 or later), and AWS Toolkit extension (version v3.68.0 or later) installed on your local machine. Optionally, if you want to connect to SageMaker spaces directly from VS Code, you should be authenticated to access AWS resources using IAM or AWS IAM Identity Center credentials. See the administrator documentation for AWS Toolkit authentication support. You use compatible SageMaker Distribution images (2.7+ and 3.1+) for running SageMaker Studio spaces, or a custom image. If you’re initiating the connection from the IDE, you already have a user profile in the SageMaker Studio domain you want to connect to, and the spaces are already created using the Studio UI or through APIs. The AWS Toolkit does not allow creation or deletion of spaces. Set up necessary permissions We’ve launched the StartSession API for remote IDE connectivity. Add the sagemaker:StartSession permission to your user’s role so that they can remotely connect to a space.\nFor the deep-linking experience, the user starts the remote session from the Studio UI. Hence, the domain default execution role, or the user’s execution role should allow the user to call the StartSession API. Modify the permissions on your domain or user execution role by adding the following policy statement:\n{ \u0026#34;Version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2012-10-17\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Statement\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;Sid\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;RestrictStartSessionOnSpacesToUserProfile\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Effect\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Allow\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Action\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;sagemaker:StartSession\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;Resource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;arn:*:sagemaker:${aws:Region}:${aws:AccountId}:space/${sagemaker:DomainId}/*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Condition\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;ArnLike\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;sagemaker:ResourceTag/sagemaker:user-profile-arn\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;arn:*:sagemaker:${aws:Region}:${aws:AccountId}:user-profile/${sagemaker:DomainId}/${sagemaker:UserProfileName}\u0026#34; } } } ] } If you’re initializing the connection to SageMaker Studio spaces directly from VS Code, your AWS credentials should allow the user to list the spaces, start or stop a space, and initiate a connection to a running space. Make sure that your AWS credentials allow the following API actions:\n{ \u0026#34;Version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2012-10-17\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Statement\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;Effect\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Allow\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Action\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;sagemaker:ListSpaces\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;sagemaker:DescribeSpace\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;sagemaker:UpdateSpace\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;sagemaker:ListApps\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;sagemaker:CreateApp\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;sagemaker:DeleteApp\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;sagemaker:DescribeApp\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;sagemaker:StartSession\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;sagemaker:DescribeDomain\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;sagemaker:AddTags\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;Resource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;*\u0026#34; } ] } This initial IAM policy provides a quick-start foundation for testing SageMaker features. Organizations can implement more granular access controls using resource Amazon Resource Name (ARN) constraints or attribute-based access control (ABAC). With the introduction of the StartSession API, you can restrict access by defining space ARNs in the resource section or implementing condition tags according to your specific security needs, as shown in the following example.\n{ \u0026#34;Version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2012-10-17\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Statement\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;Sid\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;AllowRemoteAccessByTag\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Effect\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Allow\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Action\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;sagemaker:StartSession\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;Resource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Condition\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;StringEquals\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;aws:ResourceTag/User\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;user-identifier\u0026gt;\u0026#34; } } } ] } Enable remote connectivity and launch VS Code from SageMaker Studio To connect to a SageMaker space remotely, the space must have remote access enabled. Before running a space on the Studio UI, you can toggle Remote access on to enable the feature, as shown in the following screenshot.\nAfter the feature is enabled, choose Run space to start the space. After the space is running, choose Open in VS Code to launch VS Code.\nThe first time you choose this option, you’ll be prompted by your browser to confirm opening VS Code. Select the checkbox Always allow studio to confirm and then choose Open Visual Studio Code.\nThis will open VS Code, and you will be prompted to update your SSH configuration. Choose Update SSH config to complete the connection. This is also a one-time setup, and you will not be prompted for future connections.\nOn successful connection, a new window launches that is connected to the SageMaker Studio space and has access to the Studio space’s storage.\nConnect to the space from VS Code Using the AWS Toolkit, you can list the spaces, start, connect to a space, or connect to a running space that has remote connection enabled. If a running space doesn’t have remote connectivity enabled, you can stop the space from the AWS Toolkit and then select the Connect icon to automatically turn on remote connectivity and start the space. The following section describes the experience in detail.\nAfter you’re authenticated into AWS, from AWS Toolkit, access the AWS Region where your SageMaker Studio domain is. You will now see a SageMaker AI section. Choose the SageMaker AI section to list the spaces in your Region. If you’re connected using IAM, the toolkit lists the spaces across domains and users in your Region. See the [Optional] Filter spaces to a specific domain or user below on instructions to view spaces for a particular user profile. For Identity Center users, the list is already filtered to display only the spaces owned by you.\nAfter you identify the space, choose the connectivity icon as shown in the screenshot below to connect to the space.\nOptional: Filter spaces to a specific domain or user\nWhen connecting to an account using IAM, you will see a list of spaces in the account and region. This can be overwhelming if the account has tens or hundreds of domains, users and spaces. The toolkit provides a filter utility that helps you quickly filter the list of spaces to a specific user profile or a list of user profiles. Next to SageMaker AI, choose the filter icon as shown in the following screenshot.\nYou will now see a list of user profiles and domains. Scroll through the list or enter user profile or domain name, and then select or unselect to filter the list of spaces by domain or user profile.\nUse cases Following use cases demonstrate how AI developers and machine learning (ML) engineers can use local integrated development environment (IDE) connection capability.\nConnecting to a notebook kernel After you’re connected to the space, you can start creating and running notebooks and scripts right from your local development environment. By using this method, you can use the managed infrastructure provided by SageMaker for resource-intensive AI tasks while coding in a familiar environment. You can run notebook cells on your SageMaker Distribution or custom image kernels, and can choose the IDE that maximizes your productivity. Use the following steps to create and connect your notebook to a remote kernel –\nOn your VS Code file explorer, choose the plus (+) icon to create a new file, name it remote-kernel.ipynb. Open the notebook and run a cell (for example, print (\u0026ldquo;Hello from remote IDE\u0026rdquo;). VS Code will show a pop-up for installing the Python and Jupyter extension. Choose Install/Enable suggested extensions. After the extensions are installed, VS Code will automatically launch the kernel selector. You can also choose Select Kernel on the right to view the list of kernels. For the next steps, follow the directions for the space you’re connected to. Code Editor spaces: Select Python environments… and choose from a list of provided Python environments. After you are connected, you can start running the cells in your notebook.\nJupyterLab spaces: Select the Existing Jupyter Server… option to have the same kernel experience as the JupyterLab environment. If this is the first time connecting to JupyterLab spaces, you will need to configure the Jupyter server to view the same kernels as the remote server using the following steps.\nChoose Enter the URL of the running Jupyter Server and enter http://localhost:8888/jupyterlab/default/lab as the URL and press Enter. Enter a custom server display name, for example, JupyterLab Space Default Server and press Enter.You will now be able to view the list of kernels that’s available on the remote Jupyter server. For consequent connections, this display name will be available for you to choose from when you select the existing Jupyter server option. The following graphic shows the entire workflow. In this example, we’re running a JupyterLab space with the SageMaker Distribution image, so we can view the list of kernels available in the image.\nYou can choose the kernel of your choice, for example, the Python 3 kernel, and you can start running the notebook cells on the remote kernel. With access to the SageMaker managed kernels, you can now focus on model development rather than infrastructure and runtime management, while using the development environment you know and trust.\nBest practices and guardrails Follow the principle of least privilege when allowing users to connect remotely to SageMaker Studio spaces applications. SageMaker Studio supports custom tag propagation, we recommend tagging each user with a unique identifier and using the tag to allow the StartSession API to only their private applications. As an administrator, if you want to disable this feature for your users, you can enforce it using the sagemaker:RemoteAccess condition key. The following is an example policy. { \u0026#34;Version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2012-10-17\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Statement\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;Sid\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;AllowCreateSpaceWithRemoteAccessDisabled\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Effect\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Allow\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Action\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;sagemaker:CreateSpace\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;sagemaker:UpdateSpace\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;Resource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Condition\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;StringEquals\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;sagemaker:RemoteAccess\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;DISABLED\u0026#34;] } } }, { \u0026#34;Sid\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;AllowCreateSpaceWithNoRemoteAccess\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Effect\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Allow\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Action\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;sagemaker:CreateSpace\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;sagemaker:UpdateSpace\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;Resource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Condition\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;Null\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;sagemaker:RemoteAccess\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;true\u0026#34; } } } ] } When connecting remotely to the SageMaker Studio spaces from your local IDE, be aware of bandwidth constraints. For optimal performance, avoid using the remote connection to transfer or access large datasets. Instead, use data transfer methods built for cloud and in-place data processing to facilitate a smooth user experience. We recommend an instance with at least 8 GB of storage to start with, and the SageMaker Studio UI will throw an exception if you choose a smaller instance. Cleanup If you have created a SageMaker Studio domain for the purposes of this post, remember to delete the applications, spaces, user profiles, and the domain. For instructions, see Delete a domain. For the SageMaker Studio spaces, use the idle shutdown functionality to avoid incurring charges for compute when it is not in use.\nConclusion The remote IDE connection feature for Amazon SageMaker Studio bridges the gap between local development environments and powerful ML infrastructure of SageMaker AI. With direct connections from local IDEs to SageMaker Studio spaces, developers and data scientists can now:\nMaintain their preferred development environment while using the compute resources of SageMaker AI Use custom extensions, debugging tools, and familiar workflows Access governed data and ML resources within existing security boundaries Choose between convenient deep linking or AWS Toolkit connection methods Operate within enterprise-grade security controls and permissions This integration minimizes the productivity barriers of context switching while facilitating secure access to SageMaker AI resources.

A VPC endpoint policy is an IAM resource policy that you attach to an endpoint. If you do not attach a policy when you create an endpoint, AWS attaches a default policy for you that allows full access to the service through the endpoint.\nYou can create a policy that restricts access to specific S3 buckets only. This is useful if you only want certain S3 Buckets to be accessible through the endpoint.\nIn this section you will create a VPC endpoint policy that restricts access to the S3 bucket specified in the VPC endpoint policy.\nConnect to an EC2 instance and verify connectivity to S3 Start a new AWS Session Manager session on the instance named Test-Gateway-Endpoint. From the session, verify that you can list the contents of the bucket you created in Part 1: Access S3 from VPC: aws s3 ls s3://\\\u0026lt;your-bucket-name\\\u0026gt; The bucket contents include the two 1 GB files uploaded in earlier.\nCreate a new S3 bucket; follow the naming pattern you used in Part 1, but add a \u0026lsquo;-2\u0026rsquo; to the name.

Work Environment The environment at FCJ is highly dynamic and fosters a proactive mindset (Ownership). I was particularly impressed with the culture of \u0026ldquo;Customer Obsession\u0026rdquo; and the way people dive deep into problems (Deep Dive). The workspace is conducive to concentration, but the greatest value lies in the open academic atmosphere, where every idea regarding new technologies (like GenAI or Cloud Native) is encouraged and debated enthusiastically.\n2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin Mentors not only serve as guides but also as sources of inspiration. I highly value the support received from the mentors during the preparation phase for the recent Midterm exam (October 31st). The mentors were patient in explaining difficult concepts regarding system architecture and deployment, helping me not just pass the exam but truly understand the core essence of the problem rather than merely memorizing facts.\n3. Alignment between Job and Academic Major The program is the perfect complement to the knowledge I have accumulated (Java Spring Boot, ReactJS, Python). FCJ helped me upgrade my thinking from just writing code that runs on a local machine (localhost) to a mindset of deploying systems on the Cloud, gaining clarity on VPS, DNS, and how a real-world application operates in the Internet environment. This is a crucial transformation for an engineering student.\n4. Opportunity for Learning \u0026amp; Skill Development This is the biggest highlight. Besides foundational knowledge, I had the opportunity to access the most cutting-edge technologies through events like the AWS Cloud Mastery Series. Being able to delve deep into AI/ML, DevOps, and Security (during the November workshops) significantly broadened my perspective, helping me clearly define my path toward becoming a Cloud and AI-savvy Full-stack Developer.\n5. Culture \u0026amp; Team Spirit The spirit of \u0026ldquo;Work hard, Have fun, Make history\u0026rdquo; is clearly evident. Although the pressure from Labs and exams was considerable, the support among the interns was excellent. Everyone frequently shared documentation, collaborated to debug deployment errors, and motivated each other during peak weeks.\n6. Intern Policies / Benefits I am satisfied with the program\u0026rsquo;s support, especially the opportunity to attend specialized AWS workshops and conferences (like AWS Innovate). These are non-material benefits but provide immense knowledge value that is hard to find in typical internship programs.\nOther Questions What did you enjoy most during the internship? It was the opportunity to participate in the AWS Cloud Mastery Series and the Generative AI training sessions. It ensured I wasn\u0026rsquo;t limited to just basic programming tasks but was exposed to the global technological landscape.\nWhat do you think the company should improve for subsequent interns? I propose the program could increase the number of practical, hands-on labs focusing more on Deployment and CI/CD right from the initial phase, to help subsequent interns be less overwhelmed when pushing products to the production environment.\nIf recommending to friends, would you advise them to intern here? Why? Definitely YES. This is not just a workplace but a \u0026ldquo;second university\u0026rdquo; teaching the most practical knowledge about Cloud Computing that the curriculum at school has yet to update.\nSuggestions \u0026amp; Aspirations Do you have any suggestions for improving the internship experience? I hope there will be more internal mini-hackathons to apply the learned DevOps and AI knowledge to a complete product within a short timeframe (24h-48h). Would you like to continue this program in the future? I am very keen to continue contributing and advancing further within the AWS ecosystem. Other feedback (free sharing): Thank you to the FCJ team for creating such a memorable journey from the early days of September until now.
