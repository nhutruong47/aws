Throughout my internship at **Amazon Web Services (AWS) Vietnam** (under the First Cloud Journey program) from **September 8, 2025** until now, I have had the opportunity to learn, train, and apply the knowledge acquired at school to a real-world work environment.

I have participated in **researching and deploying Cloud Computing solutions, completing specialized Labs, and passing the Midterm exam**, thereby improving my skills in **Full-stack Programming (Java/React), System Deployment, Deep Dive thinking, and Time Management**.

Regarding professional conduct, I have consistently strived to complete tasks well and actively communicated with my Mentor to enhance work efficiency. To objectively reflect upon my internship process, I assess myself based on the criteria below:

### Personal Improvement Plan

Based on the assessment table above, I recognize several areas that need improvement to become a more professional engineer:

- **Enhance Discipline and Process Compliance:**

- I realize I need to be more serious about adhering to organizational hours and administrative regulations.
  - _Action:_ Establish a tighter personal work schedule (Timeboxing), ensure punctuality for all meetings (Sync-ups), and strictly adhere to AWS security/procedural guidelines.

- **Improve Problem-Solving Skills:**

- Currently, I tend to focus on finding a quick fix rather than investigating the root cause.
  - _Action:_ Rigorously apply the **"Deep Dive"** mindset. When encountering an error, instead of just making the code run, I will dedicate time to analyze _why_ the error occurred and _how_ to prevent it in the future (using the 5 Whys methodology).

- **Boost Communication Skills:**
    - I sometimes struggle when presenting complex technical ideas or when asking for support.
    - _Action:_ Practice formulating concise questions with clear context when seeking assistance from the Mentor. Concurrently, proactively participate more in technical sharing sessions to build confidence.
