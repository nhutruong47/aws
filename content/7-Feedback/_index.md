### Overall Assessment

**1. Work Environment**  
The environment at FCJ is highly dynamic and fosters a proactive mindset (Ownership). I was particularly impressed with the culture of "Customer Obsession" and the way people dive deep into problems (Deep Dive). The workspace is conducive to concentration, but the greatest value lies in the open academic atmosphere, where every idea regarding new technologies (like GenAI or Cloud Native) is encouraged and debated enthusiastically.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
Mentors not only serve as guides but also as sources of inspiration. I highly value the support received from the mentors during the preparation phase for the recent Midterm exam (October 31st). The mentors were patient in explaining difficult concepts regarding system architecture and deployment, helping me not just pass the exam but truly understand the core essence of the problem rather than merely memorizing facts.

**3. Alignment between Job and Academic Major**  
The program is the perfect complement to the knowledge I have accumulated (Java Spring Boot, ReactJS, Python). FCJ helped me upgrade my thinking from just writing code that runs on a local machine (localhost) to a mindset of deploying systems on the Cloud, gaining clarity on VPS, DNS, and how a real-world application operates in the Internet environment. This is a crucial transformation for an engineering student.

**4. Opportunity for Learning & Skill Development**  
This is the biggest highlight. Besides foundational knowledge, I had the opportunity to access the most cutting-edge technologies through events like the _AWS Cloud Mastery Series_. Being able to delve deep into AI/ML, DevOps, and Security (during the November workshops) significantly broadened my perspective, helping me clearly define my path toward becoming a Cloud and AI-savvy Full-stack Developer.

**5. Culture & Team Spirit**  
The spirit of "Work hard, Have fun, Make history" is clearly evident. Although the pressure from Labs and exams was considerable, the support among the interns was excellent. Everyone frequently shared documentation, collaborated to debug deployment errors, and motivated each other during peak weeks.

**6. Intern Policies / Benefits**  
I am satisfied with the program's support, especially the opportunity to attend specialized AWS workshops and conferences (like AWS Innovate). These are non-material benefits but provide immense knowledge value that is hard to find in typical internship programs.

### Other Questions

- **What did you enjoy most during the internship?**  
    It was the opportunity to participate in the _AWS Cloud Mastery Series_ and the Generative AI training sessions. It ensured I wasn't limited to just basic programming tasks but was exposed to the global technological landscape.

- **What do you think the company should improve for subsequent interns?**  
    I propose the program could increase the number of practical, hands-on labs focusing more on Deployment and CI/CD right from the initial phase, to help subsequent interns be less overwhelmed when pushing products to the production environment.

- **If recommending to friends, would you advise them to intern here? Why?**  
    Definitely YES. This is not just a workplace but a "second university" teaching the most practical knowledge about Cloud Computing that the curriculum at school has yet to update.

### Suggestions & Aspirations

- **Do you have any suggestions for improving the internship experience?**  
    I hope there will be more internal mini-hackathons to apply the learned DevOps and AI knowledge to a complete product within a short timeframe (24h-48h).
- **Would you like to continue this program in the future?**
    I am very keen to continue contributing and advancing further within the AWS ecosystem.
- **Other feedback (free sharing):**
    Thank you to the FCJ team for creating such a memorable journey from the early days of September until now.
