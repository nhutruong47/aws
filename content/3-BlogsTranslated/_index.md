This section will list and introduce the blogs you have translated. For example:

### [Blog 1 - Getting started with healthcare data lakes: Using microservices](3.1-Blog1/)

This blog introduces how to start building a data lake in the healthcare sector by applying a microservices architecture. You will learn why data lakes are important for storing and analyzing diverse healthcare data (electronic medical records, lab test data, medical IoT devices…), how microservices help make the system more flexible, scalable, and easier to maintain. The article also guides you through the steps to set up the environment, organize the data processing pipeline, and ensure compliance with security & privacy standards such as HIPAA.

### [Blog 2 - From experiment to enterprise: Building AI agents with Amazon Bedrock](3.2-Blog2/)

This blog explains how organizations can transform promising AI agent experiments into enterprise-ready applications using Amazon Bedrock. It highlights the challenges companies face in building production infrastructure, such as scalability, reliability, and integration, and shows how Bedrock removes the undifferentiated heavy lifting. You will learn about the benefits of using Bedrock to quickly move from prototyping to production, how it streamlines deployment and governance, and why it enables teams to focus more on innovation rather than infrastructure management. The article also covers best practices for agent lifecycle management and enterprise adoption.

### [Blog 3 - Simplify multi-tenant encryption with a cost-conscious AWS KMS key strategy](3.3-Blog3/)

This blog introduces how organizations can simplify encryption for multi-tenant applications by using an efficient AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key strategy. It explains the trade-offs between security isolation and cost efficiency, and shows how to design an approach that balances both. You will learn why per-tenant keys provide strong isolation but can increase costs, how shared keys reduce expenses but require careful governance, and how hybrid strategies can combine the best of both. The article also covers best practices for automating key rotation, enforcing tenant-specific policies, and integrating encryption seamlessly into multi-tenant workloads.
