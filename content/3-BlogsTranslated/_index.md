This section will list and introduce the blogs you have translated. For example:

### [Blog 1 - Equinox Builds a Scalable, Repeatable Architecture Using AWS IoT Services](3.1-Blog1/)

This blog details how the premium fitness company Equinox overcame challenges with its legacy infrastructure to provide near-real-time fitness insights. You will learn how Equinox uses AWS IoT Core to securely connect its in-club workout equipment to the cloud, AWS IoT Greengrass to streamline and scale software deployments across 80 clubs, and Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to process biometric and device data. The article highlights how this new architecture solves operational issues, improves data reliability, and frees up engineers to focus on innovation, such as future AI/ML projects using Amazon SageMaker.

### [Blog 2 - AWS expands its support of ARPA-H Sprint for Women’s Health performers](3.2-Blog2/)

This blog announces that AWS is expanding its support for the ARPA-H Sprint for Women’s Health, specifically for its "Spark funding track" awardees. You will learn about the innovative, early-stage research being conducted, including projects from CalTech (a wearable sweat sensor for chronic pain assessment), Nura Health (rapid endometriosis diagnosis), Ancilia Biosciences (treating bacterial vaginosis), and General Proximity (cancer treatment). The article explains how these researchers will receive AWS credits and technical support, leveraging services like AWS HealthOmics and HPC (High-Performance Computing) to accelerate their work from idea to commercialization.

### [Blog 3 - Supercharge your AI workflows by connecting to SageMaker Studio from Visual Studio Code](3.3-Blog3/)

This blog introduces a new capability that allows AI developers and ML engineers to connect their local Visual Studio Code (VS Code) environment directly to Amazon SageMaker Studio. You will learn about three key benefits: using a familiar IDE with scalable cloud compute resources, simplifying operational setup, and maintaining enterprise-grade security. The article provides a technical walkthrough, explaining prerequisites (like the AWS Toolkit and new IAM permissions) and the two connection methods (deep linking from Studio or via the AWS Toolkit). It also guides a practical use case: running a notebook in your local VS Code while using a remote kernel from a SageMaker Studio space.
