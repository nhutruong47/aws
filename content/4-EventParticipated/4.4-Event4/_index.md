# Summary Report: “AWS Cloud Mastery Series #2: DevOps on AWS”

### Date and Topic

- **Date and Time:** Monday, November 17, 2025 (1:00 PM – 4:30 PM)
- **Topic:** DevOps on AWS

### Event Objectives

- To provide deep understanding of the principles, processes, and best practices of **DevOps** on the AWS platform.
- To introduce and guide the use of **AWS Developer Tools** (CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline) to build an automated **CI/CD pipeline**.
- To focus on advanced deployment strategies such as **Blue/Green Deployment** and **Canary Release** to mitigate risk.
- To explore how to integrate **Security (DevSecOps)** and **Monitoring** into the DevOps lifecycle.

### Speakers

- Detailed speaker information is not available in the original data, assumed to be AWS Vietnam Solution Architects/Specialists.

### Highlights

#### 1. DevOps Principles and AWS Developer Tools

- **DevOps Culture & Principles:** Focus on automation, monitoring, and continuous improvement.
- **Building CI/CD:** Guidance on using AWS CodePipeline to create a continuous deployment flow from code commit to production.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Introduction to AWS CloudFormation and AWS CDK for managing infrastructure resources as code.

#### 2. Advanced Deployment Strategies

- **Zero-Downtime Deployment:** Analysis of advanced deployment techniques:
    _ **Blue/Green Deployment:** Deploying the new version parallel to the old version, then switching traffic.
    _ **Canary Release:** Deploying the new version to a small subset of users before wider rollout.
- **AWS Services in Action:** How to use AWS services such as Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS, and AWS Lambda to support these strategies.

#### 3. Monitoring, Logging, and DevSecOps

- **Observability:** Using Amazon CloudWatch and AWS X-Ray to collect metrics, logs, and traces, helping to quickly detect and resolve issues.
- **DevSecOps:** Integrating security tools (e.g., Amazon Inspector, Amazon GuardDuty) into the Build and Deploy phases to detect vulnerabilities early ("Shift Left").

### Key Takeaways

#### Core DevOps Skills

- **Professional CI/CD Design:** Mastered how to design a robust and resilient CI/CD Pipeline using the AWS toolset.
- **Minimizing Deployment Risk:** Understood the pros and cons of Blue/Green and Canary Release, and when to apply each strategy to ensure **Zero Downtime**.

#### Security and Observability

- **DevSecOps Mindset:** Grasped the importance of "Shift Left" – integrating security as early as possible in the development lifecycle.
- **Observability:** Understood the difference between traditional Monitoring and modern Observability, and how to use **Logs, Metrics, Traces** for a comprehensive view of system performance.

### Application to Work

- **Deployment Automation:** Implementing **CodePipeline** for new projects to automate the entire Build, Test, and Deploy process.
- **Improving Go-Live Strategy:** Proposing and applying **Canary Release** strategies for critical features to ensure stability and gather early user feedback.
- **Enhancing Observability:** Integrating X-Ray for end-to-end request tracing, helping to debug microservices faster.

### Event Experience

This event was a practical session, emphasizing the shift from theory to implementation within the AWS environment.

- **Practical Value:** The deep dive into advanced deployment strategies provided direct knowledge applicable to production environments.
- **Tool Ecosystem:** Gained a clearer understanding of how tools in the AWS ecosystem (Code\* services, CloudWatch, X-Ray) work together to form a complete DevOps process.

> This event strengthened my knowledge of building, deploying, and operating software efficiently, securely, and automatically on AWS.
