# Summary Report: “AWS Cloud Mastery Series #1: AI/ML/GenAI on AWS”

### Date and Topic

- **Date and Time:** Saturday, November 15, 2025 (8:30 AM – 12:00 PM)
- **Topic:** AI/ML/GenAI on AWS

### Event Objectives

- To provide an overview of AWS's **AI/ML** services.
- To introduce **Amazon SageMaker** – the end-to-end ML platform.
- To delve into **Generative AI (GenAI)** and **Foundation Models** via **Amazon Bedrock**.
- To instruct on **Prompt Engineering** techniques and the **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture.

### Speakers

- Detailed speaker information is not available in the original data, assumed to be AWS Vietnam Solution Architects/Specialists.

### Highlights

#### 1. AWS AI/ML Services Overview

- **Amazon SageMaker:** The complete Machine Learning (ML) lifecycle, including data preparation, training, tuning, model deployment, and integrated **MLOps**.
- **Live Demo:** Hands-on walkthrough of **SageMaker Studio**.

#### 2. Generative AI with Amazon Bedrock

- **Foundation Models:** Comparison and selection guidance for models like **Claude, Llama, and Titan**.
- **Prompt Engineering:** Advanced techniques such as **Chain-of-Thought reasoning** and **Few-shot learning**.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Architecture and integration with a **Knowledge Base** to enhance accuracy and context for GenAI.
- **Bedrock Agents & Guardrails:** Building multi-step workflows and **Guardrails** (content moderation mechanisms) to ensure safety.

### Key Takeaways

#### GenAI and ML Skills

- **End-to-end ML Deployment:** Gained proficiency in the fundamental steps for effectively building and deploying ML models on **SageMaker**.
- **Bedrock Mastery:** A clear understanding of **Bedrock's** components and the capabilities of different Foundation Models.
- **RAG Technique:** Understood that the **RAG architecture** is a key factor for implementing GenAI into practical enterprise applications using private data.

### Application to Work

- **Building GenAI Proof-of-Concepts (PoC):** Using **Amazon Bedrock** to rapidly prototype GenAI use cases (e.g., document summarization, internal knowledge chatbots) with RAG techniques.
- **Prompt Optimization:** Applying the learned **Prompt Engineering** techniques to improve the quality of responses from Large Language Models.

### Event Experience

- **In-depth Practicality:** The **Live Demos** on SageMaker and Bedrock were highly valuable, providing a realistic view of service deployment.
- **Focus on Detail:** The event delved into technical aspects like model selection and optimization (Prompting), giving me a stronger foundation compared to purely introductory sessions.

> This event provided a solid foundation for me to begin working with Machine Learning and Generative AI projects on AWS.
