# Summary Report: “Vietnam Cloud Day 2025: Track for Builders”

### Date and Topic

- **Date and Time:** Thursday, September 18, 2025 (1:00 PM – 5:00 PM)
- **Topic:** Track B: Gen AI and Data

### Event Objectives

- To share strategies and best practices for building a unified, scalable **Data Foundation** on AWS.
- To introduce the strategic roadmap and trends for applying **Generative AI (GenAI)** within organizations.
- To analyze the role of **AI in the Development Lifecycle (AI-DLC)** to improve software speed and quality.
- To guide methods and services for **securing GenAI applications** across all layers (Infrastructure, Models, Applications).

### Speakers

- **Jun Kai Loke** - AI/ML Specialist SA, AWS
- **Kien Nguyen** - Solutions Architect, AWS
- **Tamelly Lim** - Storage Specialist SA, AWS
- **Binh Tran** - Senior Solutions Architect, AWS
- **Taiki Dang** - Solutions Architect, AWS
- **Michael Armentano** - Principal WW GTM Specialist, AWS

### Highlights

#### 1. Building a Unified Data Foundation on AWS for AI and Analytics Workloads

- **Unified Data Foundation:** Strategies for constructing a flexible, scalable data infrastructure, focusing on **Data Ingestion**, **Storage**, **Processing**, and **Data Governance**.

#### 2. Building the Future: Gen AI Adoption and Roadmap on AWS

- **Vision and Trends:** Sharing AWS's comprehensive vision, emerging trends, and strategic roadmap for the adoption of **Generative AI** and new GenAI services.

#### 3. AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AI-DLC) Shaping the future of Software Implementation

- **SDLC Transformation:** Redefining the software development process by embedding AI as a central collaborator (**AI-powered Execution**) to improve speed and quality.

#### 4. Securing Generative AI Applications with AWS: Fundamentals and Best Practices

- **GenAI Security Challenges:** Exploring unique security risks at each layer of the GenAI stack (**Infrastructure, Models, Applications**).
- **Best Practices:** Guidance on how AWS integrates security measures such as encryption, **Zero-Trust** architecture, and fine-grained access controls.

#### 5. Beyond Automation: AI Agents as Your Ultimate Productivity Multipliers

- **AI Agents:** Discussion on the paradigm shift from basic automation to using **AI Agents** (intelligent partners) capable of self-learning, adapting, and executing complex tasks.

### Key Takeaways

#### Data and AI Mindset

- **Data Foundation is Essential:** All AI/Analytics efforts must start with a unified, well-governed **Data Governance** foundation.
- **AI-DLC Replaces Traditional SDLC:** Learned how to embed AI into the software development lifecycle to increase speed and innovation.

#### Technical Architecture and Security

- **Multi-layer Security in GenAI:** Security must extend beyond infrastructure to protect both the model and the application flow using measures like encryption and **Zero-Trust**.
- **AI Agents - New Level of Automation:** Understood the potential of **AI Agents** in automating complex processes and exponentially multiplying business productivity.

### Application to Work

- **Enhancing Data Governance:** Applying learned data governance methods to establish unified data storage, processing, and security principles for AI/ML projects.
- **AI-DLC Experimentation:** Researching and piloting the integration of AI tools (such as Amazon Q) into the development process to automate repetitive tasks.
- **GenAI Security Design:** Ensuring that multi-layer security principles (data encryption, access control) are applied from the start when designing GenAI applications.

### Event Experience

Participating in the **Track for Builders** was a highly valuable experience, focused entirely on data-driven and AI-centric architecture.

- **Foundational and Strategic Knowledge:** I gained access not only to specific AWS services but also to the overall strategy for building a data foundation for AI and the GenAI roadmap.
- **Vision for Software Development:** The discussion on **AI-DLC** changed my perspective on SDLC, placing AI at the center of software creation.
